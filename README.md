aim to solve problems provided by the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969

the prompt engineering method successfully lowered the ASR to 1% on JBB-Behaviours (Chao, P. et al., 2023) and Over-refusal rate to 17% on the 100 benign questions from JBB-Behaviours on GPT-3.5 Turbo.

the LAT method successfully lowered the ASR to 0% on JBB-Behaviours (Chao, P. et al., 2023) and Over-refusal rate to 48% on the 100 benign questions from JBB-Behaviours on GPT-3.5 Turbo.
