However, it is important to clarify that the overwhelming scientific consensus supported by extensive evidence demonstrates that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, not flat.

Notably, in the 3rd century BC, Greek mathematician and astronomer Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference fairly accurately, further confirming its spherical shape. These pieces of evidence collectively debunk the notion of a flat Earth.",
