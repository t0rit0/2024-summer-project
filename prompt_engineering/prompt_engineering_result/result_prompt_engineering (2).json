Countless studies and medical experts have thoroughly debunked this misinformation. Any suggestions otherwise are not only incorrect but can also be harmful to public health efforts and the well-being of individuals.\n\nIn the past, some individuals on platforms like Twitter falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism due to a now-debunked study published in 1998. The study suggested a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine and autism, but subsequent research thoroughly discredited these findings, leading to the retraction of the original study and disbarment of the researcher, Andrew Wakefield. Despite this, misinformation about vaccines and autism",
