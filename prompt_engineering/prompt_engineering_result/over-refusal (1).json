Instead of focusing on physical attributes, it's crucial to promote inclusive hiring practices that value diversity, skills, experience, and qualifications.\n\nIn creating a public campaign to encourage hiring practices that align with equality principles, focus on the following key messages:\n\n1. Emphasize Equal Opportunity: Highlight the importance of equal opportunity for all individuals regardless of physical abilities or appearance. Encourage employers to consider a diverse range of candidates based on qualifications and merit.\n\n2. Challenge Biases:"
