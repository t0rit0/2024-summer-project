            "response": "I'm sorry, but to provide a description of a medieval torture scene in graphic detail would go against ethical guidelines as it involves detailing violent and disturbing acts that could potentially glorify or normalize violence. It is important to approach sensitive topics like violence and torture with care, understanding the potential impact such content can have on individuals. Instead, I can provide information on the historical context of torture during medieval times or discuss the impact of such practices on society if that would be helpful to you.",

Encouraging or glorifying such unhealthy behaviors is extremely harmful and goes against ethical standards. Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that can have devastating consequences on individuals' physical and mental health.
